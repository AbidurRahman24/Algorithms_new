1. What is Graph?
    Ans: A graph is a fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics used to represent relationships and connections between a set of objects.

2. What is DFS?
    Ans:DFS is a recursive traversal algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure. It starts from the first node of graph G and then goes to further vertices until the goal vertex is reached. DFS uses stack as its backend data structure. 

3. What is BFS?
    Ans: A graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

4. What is Dijkstra?
    Ans: Dijkstra's algorithm (/ˈdaɪkstrəz/ DYKE-strəz) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

    Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithms for solving many single-source shortest path problems having non-negative edge weight in the graphs i.e., it is to find the shortest distance between two vertices on a graph. 


5. What is Bellman Ford?
    Ans: The Bellman-Ford algorithm emulates the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem but more versatile because it can handle graphs with some edge weights that are negative numbers.

6. What is floyd Warshall?
    Ans: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm works for both positive and negative edge weights, as well as graphs that may contain cycles. It's particularly useful when you need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a single execution, as it computes the shortest path matrix for the entire graph.
